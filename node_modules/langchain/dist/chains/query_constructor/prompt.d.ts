(comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to\n\nMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.\nMake sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.\nMake sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.\nMake sure that filters are only used as needed.
