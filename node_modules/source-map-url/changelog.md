### Version 0.2.0 (2014-02-23) ###

- Changed: A space is no longer inserted before the closing comment syntax. If
  such a space is desired, it needs to be put in the closing comment syntax
  itself (such as `["/*", " */"]` instead of `["/*", "*/"]`). (Backwards
  incompatible change.)


### Version 0.1.0 (2014-02-22) ###

- Initial release.
